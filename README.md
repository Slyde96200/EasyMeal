Hello to you who read me!

Today I make available to you my EasyMeal Pack!

It contains two versions of EasyMeal

The first is delivered with its two models, but I am absolutely not satisfied with it, I included a README.md in this version so that you can know the bugs and corrections to apply



The second version is a rework of a code that was not working / that had bugs, so I took the time to fix the broken features, once done, I could style my V2 as I wanted .

This version is delivered without a model, I added a README.md to indicate the (minor) corrections that I intend to make
